I am a designer, currently working for (link: http://thesun.co.uk text: The Sun title: The Sun website, where Anwar Choukah works as a Deputy Creative Director) as Deputy Creative Director, where I've been for well over ten years.

I am the proud father of two **lovely daughters** and proud partner of my girlfriend.

Here's a code block that I *really* like. It uses flex-box to make sure the footer stays at the foot of your browser window:

```
/* HTML */

<body>
  <header>…</header>
  <main class="Site-content">…</main>
  <footer>…</footer>
</body>


/* CSS */

.body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.Site-content {
  flex: 1;
}
```

My favourite CSS declaration is ``` box-sizing: border-box; ``` and it should be yours too.

You might find me weird, but ```flex-box``` is a lot of fun.

I really want ``` float: bottom;``` to become a reality. Bend your head around that..
