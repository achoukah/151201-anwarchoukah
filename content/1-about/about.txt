Here's a code block that I *really* like. It uses flex-box to make sure the footer stays at the foot of your browser window:


(code lang: html caption: HTML)

<body>
  <header>…</header>
  <main class="Site-content">…</main>
  <footer>…</footer>
</body>

(/code)

(code lang: html caption: CSS)

.body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.Site-content {
  flex: 1;
}
(/code)

My favourite CSS declaration is (code)box-sizing: border-box;(/code) and it should be yours too.

You might find me weird, but (code)flex-box(/code) is a lot of fun.

I really want ``` float: bottom;``` to become a reality. Bend your head around that..
