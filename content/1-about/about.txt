Current favourite solution to an old problem solved by (link: http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/ text: Philip Walton title: Sticky footer using flex-box by Philip Walton) and ``` flex-box ``` a great snippet for making sure your footer behaves:

(code lang: html caption: HTML)

<body>
  <header>…</header>
  <main class="Site-content">…</main>
  <footer>…</footer>
</body>

(/code)

(code lang: css caption: CSS)

.body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}
