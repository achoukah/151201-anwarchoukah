## Web & Graphic, UI, UX, Front-end designer

I’ve been a **web and graphic designer** since 1999 and **I love what I do**.

I focus on **beautiful**, **responsive**, **cross-browser friendly code** and **device-agnostic web design**.

Originally from **Oslo, Norway**, I now live in **London, UK**.

## Who I am

(image: anwar-choukah-profile-pic.jpg alt: Anwar Choukah portrait picture)

I’m an **experienced front-end web and graphic designer** and **typography nerd**. I love the web and enjoy trying to make it **better**, **more accessible**, and **more legible**.

I am fluent in English, Norwegian, and French, fair to middling in Arabic.

I’ve had the opportunity to work for clients like [The Sun][sol], [The Sunday Times][st], [UTV][utv], [Google][google], [Hit Creative][hit], [Forient][forient], and [Tool Shed][toolshed].

### What else do I love?

Gigs, music, watching good TV shows, reading books (mainly sci-fi and non-fiction), cooking, spending time with my family.

## UI Development

I love taking designs (often my own) and convert them into live websites, whether they need a CMS like (link: http://www.wordpress.org text: WordPress popup: yes) or (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby popup: yes). This is where I find that UI micro-interactions and animations make a design come to life.

As a matter of course, accessibility, Search Engine Optimisation, and semantic markup are an integral part of how I work.
