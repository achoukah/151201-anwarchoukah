Content consultancy, logo design, technical set-up for personal website for professional journalists Anthony Harwood and Tanith Carey.

They decided to work together and have a unified front on the web.

They got in touch with me, requiring a fast turnaround for minimum cost. They needed a logo, and a functioning website.

I suggested (link: //squarespace.com/ text: Squarespace popup: yes title: Squarespace website), which I find to be remarkable value for money with the least amount of hassle.

SEO was done as a matter of course at the end of the development phase.
