Current favourite solution to an old problem solved by (link: http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/ text: Philip Walton title: Sticky footer using flex-box by Philip Walton) and ```flex-box```. This is a great, simple snippet for making sure your footer behaves:

```html
<body>
  <header>…</header>
  <main class="Site-content">…</main>
  <footer>…</footer>
</body>

```


```css
.body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.Site-content {
  flex: 1;
}

```
